## ToDo

### Important & Urgent
- [ ] multiplayer: tell who wins the race
- [ ] Make final emoji appear upon immediate completion. Should not need to press space.

### Important (High > Low)
- [ ] multiplayer: make it work more reliably. 
- [ ] multiplayer: show stats of both players during/finish race
- [ ] singleplayer mode to encourage competitiveness
- [ ] Fix accuracy increase when deleting text
- [ ] start card/ Count down to start race. maybe a button to do so
- [ ] Make code/comment refactorings for cleanliness/readability (Certainly, if this is not intended to be abandoned after today)
- [ ] Some visual feedback/END CARD after finishing a race. Should encourage more racing
- [ ] multiplayer: polish finishing emoji feature

### Urgent
- [ ] change the emoji(s) for more family friendliness
- [ ] GGJ stuff. Make a 90 sec video and put on YT. Take more screenshots, etc. 

### Neither/Maybe Should Implement
- [ ] Show which emoji is you. 
- [ ] various difficulty settings/game modes
- [ ] Better web styling/UI
- [ ] Make a good text generator for infinite possibilities
- [ ] High score list/game playing statistics
- [ ] ???
