- [ ] singleplayer mode to encourage competitiveness
- [ ] start card/ Count down to start race. maybe a button to do so
- [ ] Make code/comment refactorings for cleanliness/readability/maintainability (Certainly, if this is not intended to be abandoned after today)
- [ ] Some visual feedback/END CARD after finishing a race. Should encourage more racing
- [ ] multiplayer: polish finishing emoji feature
- [ ] Correct the bee-movie texts that have words with 'O' replacing certain characters. E.g. "Oongratulations" -> "Congratulations"
- [ ] Put some sort of introduction to tell people how to play
